# ITunes-Search-API (Yapo.cl challenge 2019)
This was the challenge that I had to develop to demonstrate my skills and knowledge as an Android Developer.

## Challenge

Hi Miguel,

Just as we discussed in the interview, we're going to ask you to develop an Android application that allows searching for artists and playing the results from the iTunes Search API affiliate.itunes.apple.com/...

Please use a public Github repository for the development of your solution. Feel free to use third-party libraries you're comfortable with.

Your priorities should be:
- Ensuring the application functions correctly and can play the audio for each result.
- Clean code, design patterns, and architecture; it would be ideal to use Clean Architecture or MVP.
- (Optional) Adding functionality to add/remove a result as a favorite and listing them in an additional view.

Once you're finished, send us the repository link for review. We'll then contact you to discuss how to proceed in the process.

Best regards and good luck!

## How I developed the app
- Architecture: MVP
- Language: Java
